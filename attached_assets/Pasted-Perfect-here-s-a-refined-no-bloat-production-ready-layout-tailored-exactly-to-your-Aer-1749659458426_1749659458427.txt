## 🎯 Streamlit Tabs (Each Tied to a Proposal Objective)

### 1. 🏁 **Overview**

* Airport selector: DEL or JAI
* Profile info: passenger volume, retail density, target revenue
* Baseline vs target revenue per passenger
* Dwell time and NPS baseline

---

### 2. 🧠 **AI Recommendations (Retail Personalization)**

* Input: Passenger type (business/leisure), time of day
* Model: Collaborative filtering engine
* Output: Top 3 offer suggestions
* **KPI**: Conversion lift estimate (based on product affinity)

---

### 3. 💸 **Dynamic Pricing**

* Input sliders: Crowd level (low/med/high), time of day
* Model: Q-learning price agent
* Output: Suggested price adjustment (+/- %)
* Graph: Price vs revenue simulation over 24h
* **KPI**: % uplift from base pricing

---

### 4. 💬 **Sentiment & NPS**

* Input: Free text feedback or simulate
* Model: TextBlob (or Transformers)
* Output: Sentiment + mapped NPS category
* Graph: Real-time NPS trend (based on feedback flow)
* **KPI**: Target NPS improvement (+10 pts)

---

### 5. ⚖️ **DEL vs JAI Comparison**

* Side-by-side bar graphs for:

  * Revenue uplift
  * Dwell time change
  * NPS trend
  * App engagement
* Shows **why the AI works differently in a Tier-1 vs Tier-2 airport**

## ✅ Minimum ML Required (But Real)

| Model           | Purpose                         | Tool                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Recommender     | Personalized retail/F\&B offers | `Surprise` or `LightFM`               |
| Dynamic Pricing | Price optimization per context  | Q-learning (NumPy or `gym`)           |
| Sentiment → NPS | Feedback NLP                    | `TextBlob` (or HuggingFace for bonus) |

---

## 🧪 Simulated Data Strategy

Generate CSVs with:

* Passenger segment ratios (55/45 DEL, 30/70 JAI)
* Random product interactions (transaction matrix)
* Feedback pool with 3 sentiment levels and NPS mappings (Detractor, Passive, Promoter)

## 🧠 How This Aligns with Your Proposal

| Proposal KPI               | Where It Shows                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| ₹312 → ₹390 uplift         | Revenue tab, comparison tab           |
| NPS +10                    | Sentiment tab                         |
| Retail uplift via offers   | Recommender tab                       |
| Dynamic pricing model      | Pricing tab                           |
| DEL vs JAI contrast        | Comparison tab                        |
| Scalable, AI-driven design | Modular logic, config-driven profiles |

## ❌ What’s *Intentionally Excluded* (Not Needed)

* No IoT/thermal sensor integrations
* No computer vision (YOLOv8) — just simulated crowd level
* No login/auth
* No unnecessary chatbot or passenger mobile UI (AirMate-style)

---

## 🧠 Final Verdict

This version:

* ✅ **Reflects your pilot 1:1**
* ✅ Uses **real, minimal ML**
* ✅ Simulates **real KPIs that airports care about**
* ✅ Is focused, modular, explainable, and ready for demo or scaling
